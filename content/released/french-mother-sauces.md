There are 5 main french sauces: Espagnole, Velouté, Tomato, Béchamel, Hollandaise (Mayonnaise)\
Everything else is considered a derivative (daugther sauce).\
Alex (the french guy) has [a great series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcDk-JcAnOw&list=PLURsDaOr8hWX1T2WSXhPwL110La-GxjYY) on them.\
There is also this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_mother_sauces) page.
